The Rashtrapati Bhavan is the official residence of the President of India and is a rambling mansion with breath taking architecture. Spread over 320 acres, the vast grounds of the Rashtrapati Bhavan are home not only the head of state, but also staff quarters, stables, offices and the beautiful and famed Mughal Gardens. 

The Rashtrapati Bhavan was designed by British architect, Edwin Lutyens and is a unique amalgamation of Mughal and European architecture. Such is the grandeur of this mansion that very few residences of heads of states from around the world can match up to the extravagance that is the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Situated at the eastern edge of Rajpath, the Rashtrapati Bhavan faces the India Gate, which lies at the Western edge of the same road. 

On either side of the Rashtrapati Bhavan lie the North Block and South Block, which house various ministries of the Government of India. The lavish Mughal Gardens lie behind the North Block and South Block, which opens to the public from mid-February to mid-March. Apart from this you can also enjoy a guided tour of a few section of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, such as the Durbar Hall, Lutyens’ Gallery, Long Drawing Room, Ashoka Hall, Children’s Gallery and Gift Museum which have now been opened to the public.
