The Baha’I House of Worship, more popularly known as the Lotus Temple, owing to its shape and design, is one of Delhi’s most recognized structures. 

The Lotus temple, constructed entirely out of white marble, is known for its modern architecture, which stands out against the concrete jungle around it. The temple consists of twenty seven massive marble petals shaped like an unfolding lotus flower, which rises from nine pools and walkways. The number nine signifies the nine unifying paths of the Baha’i faith. A little niche under each petal contains sayings from the Baha’I scriptures. 

The temple does not contain any idols or images, as it is against the Bah’i faith and visitors are welcome to meditate inside the temple silently. The temple is surrounded by beautifully maintained laws and the best time to visit the temple is during sunset.
