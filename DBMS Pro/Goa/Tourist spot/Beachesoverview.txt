Goa has well over 25 amazing beaches ranging from the full-of-life party destinations to the serene and peaceful ones. As a general assumption, the beaches of North Goa are considered to be more happening and lively than those of South Goa which are quieter and more secluded. 

North Goa offers sprightly beaches like Baga, Calangute, Anjuna and Colva, that necklace the northern coastline with tons of shacks buzzing with life, serving lip-smacking delicacies from the Konkan cuisine with cocktails and mocktails to go along; Goa’s beaches make your holiday experience complete. 

South Goa is rather mellow, with serene beaches like Arambol, Palolem and Galgibaga (famous as a nesting ground for Olive Ridley turtles) which are cut off from the world, but really worth paying a visit if you are looking for some peace and quiet.
