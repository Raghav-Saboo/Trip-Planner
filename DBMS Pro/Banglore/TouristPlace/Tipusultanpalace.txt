The grand summer palace of Tipu Sultan has now been converted into a museum, and it is a must-see attraction in Bangalore. Magnificent figures, paintings and other artwork adorn this palace. A unique feature of the palace is that it had been constructed using pure teak wood, something that is hard to find in today’s world.
