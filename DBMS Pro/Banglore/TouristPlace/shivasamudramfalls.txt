The island town of Shivasamudra in Karnataka is where the River Kaveri after winding its way through the Deccan Plateau drops off to form beautiful twin waterfalls. The falls are located about 39 kilometres from Bangalore. 

You can also visit a number of ancient temples including Shivanasamuram and Somanathpur Temple, which are located around this region. This is also the site of the first hydro-electric power station in India. 

The best time to visit the waterfalls is between June and September as the water swells up during the monsoon making the falls look incredibly beautiful. But the weather is nice all year round.
