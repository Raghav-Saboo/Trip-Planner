Situated in the middle of the forests in the valley of the famous Champakadhama hills, the Bannerghatta National Park, a rich natural zoological reserve, works towards conservation of wildlife and promotes responsible wildlife tourism. 

Located just 22 kilometres south of Bangalore, it takes roughly one and a half hours to get there. It’s one of the few natural parks in the world that preserves wildlife in such close proximity to a city. 

It comprises a zoo, safari, butterfly park and rescue center that carries out conservation and rehabilitation of orphaned animals. The animals of the park are provided with an ambience that allows them to live in harmony with nature.
