Located a kilometre away from the Chini ka Rauza, Rambagh is one of the oldest gardens to be built by the first Mughal Emperor, Babur. The gardens were originally named Araam Bagh (gardens of rest), which was subsequently shortened to Ram Bagh after the Hindu God, Ram. It is believed that Babur was initially buried here before his body was exhumed and moved to Kabul. 

The Rambagh gardens have been built in a Persian style with ample pathways and canals, representative of the Islamic idea of paradise, running through it. These gardens are also an excellent example of the Charbagh style of gardens, which served as a model of all subsequent Mughal gardens. Initially, the Ram Bagh gardens contained three plunging terraces, with water from the Yamuna drawn through them. Today, most of these waterways and walkways have gone through heavy renovation and restoration, though none of them contain water any longer. Compared to its earlier glory, unfortunately, the condition of the Rambagh gardens today has changed for the worse. However, the place is of great interest to history buffs.
