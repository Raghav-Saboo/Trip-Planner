Chini ka Rauza is the tomb of Afzal Khan, a Persian poet who was also a minister in the court of Shah Jahan. This tomb is a landmark of Indo-Persian architecture and is the first building in India to be adorned with glazed tile work. The Chini ka Rauza is a brown, rectangular building, yet its most striking feature remains its tiles or chini in different hues such as turquoise, orange, yellow and green. The inside of the tomb is decorated with now fading paintwork and inscriptions from the Quran.
