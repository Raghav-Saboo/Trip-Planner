A garden built on the banks of Yamuna River, Mehtab Bagh was constructed by Emperor Babur and was the last of a series of 11 such gardens built along the east bank of the river. Mehtab Bagh was built as an integral part of the Taj complex as the gardens of the Taj are perfectly aligned with Mehtab Bagh, making it the best place to view the Taj from. 

Mehtab Bagh also joins two other gardens to the west known as the Chahar Bagh Padshshi and Second Chahar Bagh Padshahi. Originally, four sandstone towers marked the corners of Mehtab Bagh of which only one at the south east edge remains. The gardens also contain a large pond on its outer edges which reflects the image of the Taj. Apart from water channels that enhance the beauty of the natural scenery, there is also a small tank in the centre of the garden. Visit Mehtab Bagh to enjoy its broad walkways, breezy canopies, beautiful pools, fountains and fruit trees. Mehtab Bagh provides a great photo opportunity for shutterbugs courtesy the views of the Taj Mahal that one can get from here.
