Spread over a sprawling 94 acres, this massive red sandstone fort lies parallel to the Yamuna River and is situated 2 kilometres northwest of the Taj Mahal. The Agra Fort was originally occupied by Sikarwar Rajputs and was later captured by Lodi rulers of Delhi. In 1526, after the Lodis were defeated in the Battle of Panipat, the victor Emperor Babur took over the fort. After losing the fort briefly to the Suri rulers, it was eventually reclaimed by Akbar who made Agra his capital. Akbar carried out extensive renovation of the dilapidated fort using red sandstone, which took over 4,000 workers and eight years to complete. Agra Fort is known for its majestic gates with the most impressive being the Delhi Gate and Lahore Gate. Another majestic gate is the Elephant Gate, which is situated between two red sandstone towers. Despite the magnificence of these gates, currently only the Amar Singh Gate is open to visitors. 

Visitors must note that there is no provision to buy water and other bottled drinks inside the fort and it is advised to carry water along since exploring the fort can prove to be a long and tiring experience.
