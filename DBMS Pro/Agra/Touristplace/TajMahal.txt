Undoubtedly one of Agra’s most popular attractions, the Taj Mahal is not just famous in India but is a monument renowned across the world. Built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his deceased wife Mumtaz, it is emblematic of the emperor’s deep love for his wife and the grief he experienced at her passing. A landmark monument and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal is one of the most admired Mughal masterpieces in the world and is nothing short of poetry crafted in marble. The architect of the Taj Mahal was Ustad Ahmed Lahauri and the design is representative of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles of architecture. It took 21 years for the Taj Mahal to be constructed (from 1632 to 1652) with over 20,000 labourers working night and day.

Described as a “teardrop on the face of eternity” by legendary poet Rabindranath Tagore, the Taj Mahal never fails to impress visitors. Take a relaxed stroll through the grounds or just sit and admire the beautiful, reflective pools and exquisite gardens on the premises. To truly experience its ethereal beauty, visit the Taj Mahal early in the morning when it’s relatively quieter and less crowded or on a full moon night when the white marble glows against the backdrop of the dark, night sky.
