Flanked by the majestic Yamuna on one side and the Anguri Bagh on the other, Khas Mahal, also known as Aramgah-i-Muqaddar, was a private palace built by Shah Jahan for his daughters Roshnara and Jahanara. Construction of the Khas Mahal began in 1631 and was completed in 1640. The Khas Mahal has heavily adorned ceilings and alcoves in the walls around. They once contained portraits of Mughal rulers. Iron rings visible on the ceilings were where chandeliers once hung. Take a stroll through Khas Mahal and enjoy its beautiful tanks, fountains, marble domes, open courtyards and a large central hall. 

The interiors of the palace are adorned with gold work, mural paintings, ornamental designs and floral designs. The pavilions of the Khas Mahal were constructed using red sandstone and coated with white shell plaster. They contained beautiful golden work and fresco paintings. Gold and blue, the 2 royal colours of the time have been used extensively and some traces of them are still visible in the Khas Mahal.
