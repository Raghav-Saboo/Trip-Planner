Located a kilometre north of Sikandra (a suburb of Agra) is Mariam's Tomb, the final resting place of Akbar’s wife and Jahangir’s mother, Marium-uz-Zamani Begum. Mariam’s Tomb, though largely plain, is a large sandstone structure with intricate carvings covering its outer walls. Unlike other Mughal monuments, the tomb has no domes and large chhatris top the corners of the building instead. The architecture of the tomb is a unique combination of Islamic and Hindu styles, which had gained popularity during the rule of Akbar and Jahangir. The interiors of the tomb are segmented by a grid of crisscrossing corridors and like most Mughal tombs, Mariam’s grave lies in a vault below the surface of the tomb.
