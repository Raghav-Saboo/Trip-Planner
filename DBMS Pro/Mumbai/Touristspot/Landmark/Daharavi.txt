Some would find it quite ironic that Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra and often called India’s financial capital, is home to one of the largest slums in the world. The area is known as Dharavi, which in many ways sum up the extreme paradoxes that exist in India. There is no verifiable source that claims Dharavi to be the largest slum in Asia; however, the importance of this area to Mumbai’s economic framework is undeniable. 

Mumbai is a city that is always on the edge as something or the other keeps happening. There would be no better representation of this fact better than Dharavi - a place where everything happens in the fast lane. The hardcore labour class, which runs the city at an operational level, resides right here, in the heart of Mumbai. 

Despite being a slum that battles with basic issues like hygiene and sanitation, it is a big centre of commerce and trade. Many small scale industries and businesses are based here, including some of the units that are engaged in producing export quality goods. 

There is a lot about Dharavi that would intrigue tourists, especially those who are absolutely alien to the concept of a slum. For a number of visitors, this place can be an eye-opener or a reality check. Just to see so many people crammed into one small place and going about their businesses as usual is a remarkable sight. Many foreigners, some from a research perspective and others just wanting to lower their curiosity levels, visit Dharavi.
