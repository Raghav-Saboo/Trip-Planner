Officially known as Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link, Bandra Worli Sea Link is an eight-lane cable-stayed bridge that links the regions of Bandra and Worli. It has pre-stressed concrete-steel viaducts on either side, which provide strength to it. The bridge is proposed to link the western suburbs of Mumbai with Nariman Point, the main business centre. This magnificent bridge was built by Hindustan Construction Company on the orders of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). It was opened for public in June 2009 and since then has tremendously reduced the travel time between Bandra and Worli.
