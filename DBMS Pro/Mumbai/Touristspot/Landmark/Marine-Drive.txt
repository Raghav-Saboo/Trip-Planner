Marine Drive, officially known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Marg, is a 3 kilometre long boulevard which stretches from Nariman Point to Malabar Hills. It is an inverted 'C'-shaped six lane road in southern Mumbai, running along the coast of the Arabian Sea. Famed for a large number of Art Deco buildings that were built by wealthy Parsis during the early 20th century, this necklace-shaped stretch is worth exploring. Listed among the most posh areas of the city, Marine Drive features many high-end hotels and restaurants. Walkeshwar, the house of Maharashtra's Governor, is also located in this area. 

Towards the north of Marine Drive is the popular Chowpatty Beach. At night, with the street lights are on, the entire road appears like a dazzling diamond neckpiece, hence its also referred as 'Queen's Necklace'. The highlight of this place is the beautiful promenade, which is lined with several palm trees. Considered as one of world's largest viewing gallery, Marine Drive attracts millions of tourists every year.
