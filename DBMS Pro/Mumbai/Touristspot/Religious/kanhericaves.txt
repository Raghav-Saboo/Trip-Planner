A fascinating cluster of rock-cut monuments, Kanheri Caves is situated deep inside the famous Sanjay Gandhi National Park. These caves date back to the ancient times (3rd century BC to 11th century AD), and are believed to be the country's oldest and largest cave formations in a single hill. This place served as a major centre of worship, meditation and education for Buddhist. The various inscriptions and epigraphs written in Brahmi, Devanagari and Pahlavi narrate an interesting saga of the civilisation that existed centuries ago. 

The caves have chaityagrihas with rock-cut stupas where Buddhists worshipped. There are single and multiple celled viharas or monasteries that were abode to Buddhist monks. The caves also had podhis or water cisterns which were dug skilfully to trap rainwater for use during summers. The initial caves are small and unadorned, consisting of a single cell with front-pillared verandahs. 

The most distinguished of these caves is Cave number 3, which is India's second largest chaityagriha, after Karle in Pune. The unparalleled feature of these caves is that each one has a stone podium or rock bed, unlike other caves in the country. The most impressive attractions of these caves are exquisite paintings of Gautam Buddha and a large Buddhist image known as Dagoba. 

Apart from enlightening visitors on Buddhism, the ancient Kanheri Caves are a delight for nature lovers. Famed as the 'Lungs of Mumbai', this is the only place in the commercial city that boasts of abundant greenery and consequently, a lot of fresh air. Replete with small waterfalls, natural streams, rivers and dense forests along with serene surroundings, these caves are perfect for family outings.
