Dedicated to Lord Siddhivinayak, a form of Lord Ganesha, Shree Siddhivinayak is one of Mumbai's holiest places. It is located strategically in Prabhadevi and is often frequented by Bollywood stars and other celebrities. It is believed that Ramakrishna Jambhekar Maharaj, a disciple of Hindu Saint Akkalkot Swami Samarth, buried two idols of divine importance in front of Lord Siddhivinayak's idol in the temple. Swami Samarth predicted that after 21 years of the burial, a Mandar Tree with swayambhu (self-manifested) Ganesha will grow at that spot. The prominence of the temple rose when the prophecy came true. 

Originally, the temple was a small structure and had a dome-shaped shikhara along with an idol of Lord Siddhivinayak at the centre. The idol was carved of a single 2.5 feet wide black stone. It was a chaturbhuj idol with an eye etched on the forehead. Another unique feature of the idol was the trunk which tilted towards the right side. Although the whole temple was renovated in 1990, the main idol was kept intact. 

The new design of the shrine is based on the architectural style of the Shiva Temple at Ambernath. Today, Siddhivinayak Temple is a palace-like 6-storey structure that flaunts a central gold-plated dome. Small crowns surrounding the main dome are made of gold and panchadhatu (a unique amalgamation of five metals). The wooden doors of the sanctum are carved with images of Ashtavinayakam (eight forms of Lord Ganesha). 

Ganesha Chaturthi and various other festivals are celebrated with pomp and show at Siddhivinayak temple every year. A small temple of Lord Hanuman is built within the premises of this edifice. People belonging to different religions come here to offer prayers and seek blessings of Lord Ganesha.
