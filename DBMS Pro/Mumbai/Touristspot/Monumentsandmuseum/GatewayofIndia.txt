The Gateway of India is an emblematic landmark not only in Mumbai but in the entire country. Located on the southern part of the city, the gateway overlooks the splendid Arabian Sea. This magnificent edifice was constructed to memorialize King George V and Queen Mary's visit to India in 1911. It was designed by George Wittet and took around 13 years to complete the project. The monument was inaugurated on 4th December, 1924. 

Flaunting flawless Indo-Saracenic architecture, this structure has been built in yellow basalt stone. Its archway is 26 metres high, which is joined with four turrets. A monument that speaks volumes about the political history of the country, Gateway of India is the perfect place to get acquainted with the spirited life of Mumbai and is a favourite among history buffs, tourists and photographers.
