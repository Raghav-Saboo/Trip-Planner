Nehru Planetarium, a part of the famous Nehru Centre, was inaugurated on 3rd March 1977 by the former Prime Minister of India - Indira Gandhi. It features a Digistar 3 projector, which was installed around a decade ago, in the year 2003. Over the decades, the planetarium has grown into a prominent centre for the study of astronomical sciences. Besides, it serves as a meeting ground for scientists and scholars for conducting important discussions and lectures. 

To inspire students, events like quiz contests, astro-painting and science elocution are organised here on a regular basis. One can also enjoy watching and studying Lunar and Solar eclipses - an enthralling experience. Outside the planetarium, a number of telescopes are installed to make it easy for you to enjoy the splendid views of stars and planets.
