A five-day festival of the who’s who in the literary world. Meet writers, poets, playwrights, artists and journalists from around the world with back-to-back parallel sessions on various current issues. All this toppled with great food and a musical evening which has now become a main attraction of the event with several noted musicians and bands performing live on all five days.
