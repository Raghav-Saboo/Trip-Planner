Amber Fort is the iconic attraction of Jaipur and a must on your itinerary. Suraj Pole, the sun facing royal entrance to the fort, is one of the classic blends of Hindu and Mughal architecture. Marvels like Ganesh Pol, Sila Devi Temple, Sheesh Mahal, Magic Flower Fresco and Man Singh Palace await you in the interiors of Amber Fort. 

An elephant ride up to Amber Fort is an absolute must. It’s an exhilarating experience to ride up along the cobbled path to the magnificent Fort astride an equally majestic elephant. Watching the Light and Sound Show at the Amber Fort is also a great way to spend an evening in Jaipur.
